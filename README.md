## Game play
### Setting up the game
Open up the board. Shuffle the deck. The deck consists of 66 cards, 6 special locations and 60 cards with 10 cards of each color.

### Starting the game
The youngest player will kick off the game. Play order is in a clockwise fashion.

### During a turn
Draw a card from the top of the deck. If the card is one square, move to the nearest color. If the card is two squares, move to the secondmost nearest color. If the card is a picture, Move to the designated square. If you land on a space that has a bridge, you transfer directly to the destination location. If you land on a licorice space, skip your next turn. If you draw the last card of the deck, shuffle the discarded pile and this now becomes the deck.

### Ending the game
When a player lands on the multi colored space (end space) the game is over.
